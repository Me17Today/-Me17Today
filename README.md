## Hello everyone! This is my first attempt at creating a profile on GitHub!

So uh, yeah. I'm going to test text styles now.

First off, it seems that pressing enter twice makes a new paragraph. Neato!

**This is bold.**

*This is italic.*

***This is bold and italic.***

**Emphasis on *this* word.**

~~Strikethrough!~~

<sub>subscript?</sub>

<sup>superscript!</sup>

<ins>And of course, underline.</ins>

Watch me quote something!
> "Yes."

I wonder who said that?

Now, it's time to get down to business.
